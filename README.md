**This is currently a work in progress and is currently incomplete.**

TODO:

- [x] Make navbar work with Safari

- [x] Make login/signup fields smaller for phones

- [ ] Syntax highlighting on comment code

- [ ] Copy Code button for example code

- [ ] Delete accounts (maybe show on comments)

- [ ] Forgot.php Have Forgotten password codes expire after a set amount of time. Have a new code every time user uses Forgot.php

- [ ] Signup.php Remove placeholders on Signup and make them into an info icon

- [ ] ResetPass.php Maybe re-evaluate the return values as the logic is awkward.

- [ ] index.php Add links to Topic pages and blog

- [x] navbar.php Change inline style to main.css

- [x] Generator.php Output needs to be more than one line long

- [ ] Login.php have a link to change password (maybe same as Forgot.php)

- [ ] comments.inc.php refactor the comment queries.

- [x] comments.inc.php ensure no empty comments / no pure whitespace comments
